<h3>Configuring Enigma Machine</h3>

The rotor settings takes you to another page from where you can select which rotors to use, and the position and ring settings for each. Pressing cancel on the rotor settings screen will take you back to the main screen without saving the settings. The plugboard settings will take you to a page where you can select the plugboard connections.
